# SeleniumAmazon

This is a personal practice project of using Selenium with Python to run quality assurance tests on the Amazon website.

Due to being a third party and having no special access, there are certain features that I cannot run tests on, including any financial features

Because of Amazon's bot protection activating against any automated attempts to access it, you will need to install an additional Python package of amazoncaptcha (https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/) to be able to run the tests successfully
